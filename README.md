Project Name: Gamer Test
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Design Process:
We have referred to https://www.arealme.com/apm-actions-per-minute-test/en/ for our test ideas and the user interface and revise accordingly. We have also thought of using restDb.io to record user test data and print out the top 5 best result in the leaderboard page. We thought of implementing the create account and login function in the future to track players improvment record.
